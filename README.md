What your project is/does (and what it's called)
I made this project by myself for my school's JH Science Olympiad team. It's a website that is mainly used as a study resource for my team and is not yet official, which is why there are a lot of placeholders. 
Why did you make your project
I made it because my team needed a place where we could have easy access to our resources and docs.
How do you make your project
I made it using mainly HTML and CSS with some Java for animations. 
What you struggled with and what you learned
I definitely struggled with the animations, but it also helped me learn to problem-solve and have more patience.
