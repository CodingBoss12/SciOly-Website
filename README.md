What your project is/does (and what it's called)
I made this project by myself for my school's JH Science Olympiad team. It's a website which is mainly used as a study resource for my teama nd not yet official which is why there's a lot of placeholders. 
Why you made your project
I made it because my team needed a place where we can have easy access to our resources and docs.
How you made your project
I made it using mainly html and css with some java for animations. 
What you struggled with and what you learned
I definetly struggled with the animations but it also helped me learn to promblem solve and have more patience.
